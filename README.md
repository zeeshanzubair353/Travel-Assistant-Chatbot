# Travel Assistant Chatbot

An interactive multi-agent chatbot built with **Chainlit** and **Google Gemini API**, designed to assist users with travel-related queries such as Hotels, Transport, and Food services.

## Features

- **Triage Agent:** Categorizes user queries into Hotels, Transport, or Food.  
- **Guardrail Agent:** Ensures questions are travel-related and prevents irrelevant queries.  
- **Department Agents:**  
  - **Hotel Representative** â€“ Handles hotel-related questions.  
  - **Transport Representative** â€“ Handles transport-related questions.  
  - **Food Representative** â€“ Handles food-related queries.  
- **Async Handling:** Powered by asynchronous agents for efficient processing.  
- **Integration with Gemini API:** Uses `gemini-2.5-flash` model for natural language understanding.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git
cd <repository-name>
```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

3. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
Create a `.env` file with your Gemini API key:
```

## Usage

Start the chatbot using **Chainlit**:

```bash
chainlit run main.py
```

- On chat start, the bot will greet the user:
```
ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I am your Travel Assistant. Ask me about Hotels, Transport, or Food.
```

- Ask a question about travel, and the **Triage Agent** will categorize it.  
- The appropriate **department agent** will respond with detailed guidance.  
- If a query is not travel-related, the **Guardrail** will block it.
